# Fluidgallery
Replicating and improving fluidbox with a gallery option. Using .animate
# Introduction
This is a plugin inspired by fluidbox https://github.com/terrymun/Fluidbox with some minor enhancments it works with multiple images allowing a gallery and uses jQuery animate instead of CSS translate for better IE8 compatability plus some other minor tweaks. At the moment this is still having the finishing touches applied but feel free to use or play around with.
